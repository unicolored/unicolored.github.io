<ul>
  <li>Incremental Indexing: Only syncs changes between your Jekyll site and
Meilisearch, saving you time and resources.</li>
  <li>Configurable Settings: Customize fields, collections through your _config.yml
file.</li>
  <li>Robust Error Handling: Includes retries and fallback options to ensure smooth
operation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started-️">Getting Started: 🛠️</h2>

<p>Add the gem to your Jekyll site’s Gemfile:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"jekyll-meilisearch"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"~&gt; 0.4.1"</span> <span class="c1"># beta version</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Run bundle install.</li>
  <li>Configure your _config.yml with Meilisearch settings.</li>
  <li>Build your site and watch the magic happen! 🪄</li>

called <em>Chessfield Live</em>
(<a href="/projects/2025/03/13/introducing-chessfield-live.md.html">read it here</a>).
Since then, things have evolved a bit, and I’m excited to give you an update:
it’s now 🍿 <strong>Chesspop Live</strong>, with a new name, some fresh features, and the
same 3D chess magic you loved. Let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="a-new-name-chesspop-live-">A New Name: Chesspop Live 🍿</h2>

<p>First off, why the name change? I originally went with <em>Chessfield Live</em> to tie
it to my <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chessfield">Chessfield</a> package, but I
realized it wasn’t quite popping (pun intended) for casual chess fans like me.
<em>Chesspop Live</em> is shorter, catchier, and works great in both English and
French—perfect for grabbing some popcorn and enjoying a game! You can check it
out live at <a href="https://chesspop.live">chesspop.live</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sound-effects-feel-the-game">Sound Effects: Feel the Game</h2>

<p>One of the coolest new additions is <strong>sound</strong>. Now, when you watch a game,
you’ll hear the pieces pop! It’s a small touch, but it really brings that
over-the-board vibe to your screen. I wanted <em>Chesspop</em> to feel alive, not just
look it, and sound was the missing piece (pun intended again!).</p>

<h2 id="same-3d-goodness-powered-by-chessfield">Same 3D Goodness, Powered by Chessfield</h2>

<p>The core hasn’t changed: <em>Chesspop Live</em> still uses my
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chessfield">Chessfield</a> package to render live
games in 3D. It pulls streams from places like
<a href="https://lichess.org/tv">Lichess.org</a>, so you can spectate real-time matches
with a fresh, interactive twist. Whether it’s a blitz battle or a slow strategy
showdown, it’s all there in glorious 3D.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>I’m thrilled with how <em>Chesspop Live</em> is shaping up, but there’s more to come!
I’m thinking about adding options to pick specific streamers or games, maybe
even some fun visual themes. Got ideas? I’d love to hear them—drop me a note via
<a href="https://github.com/unicolored/chesspop.live/issues">GitHub issues</a>!</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try It Out</h2>

<p>Head over to <a href="https://chesspop.live">chesspop.live</a> and give it a spin. The UI’s
smooth, the 3D board’s popping, and now the sounds make it feel like you’re
right at the table. Grab a snack, turn up your speakers, and enjoy the show! If
you love what you see and want to support more chessy goodness, feel free to
<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/unicolored">buy me a coffee</a>—it keeps the popcorn
flowing!</p>

<p>Thanks for following along—stay tuned for more chessy updates!</p>
