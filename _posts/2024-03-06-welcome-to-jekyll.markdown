Gilles here! Keeping track of my developer journey through projects, experiments, and open source collaborations.

Gonna note down my progress, learnings, and experiences.

Let's see how far I can go!

{% highlight typescript %}
class DevDiary {
  private diaryEntries: string[] = [];

  constructor() {
    this.diaryEntries.push(`ðŸš€ Let's go!`);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
