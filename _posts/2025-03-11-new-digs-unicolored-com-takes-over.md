Hey folks,

Big news: my blog’s moved to [unicolo.red](https://unicolo.red). The old haunt, [gilles.blog](https://gilles.blog), was hitting my wallet harder than a cloud bill after forgetting to shut down a VM. So, I grabbed a sleeker domain and kept the Jekyll + GitHub Pages combo rolling.

Everything’s migrated—no broken links here (I hope). If you’ve got gilles.blog bookmarked, swap it out for unicolo.red. What do you think of the new spot? And seriously, what’s the wildest domain price you’ve seen? I need stories to justify this switch.
