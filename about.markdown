Hey there! I’m **Gilles Hoarau**, aka _unicolored_—a versatile creative
developer with a passion for painting the tech world red. Welcome to _The Red
Journey_, where I share 18 years of coding, creating, and collaborating—always
with a bold, red-hot twist.

## A Career in Red

For nearly two decades, I’ve served clients and partners—small startups to
global giants—both solo and with brilliant teams. From web dev challenges to
bleeding-edge innovation, I’m ready to tackle it all. How can I assist _you_?

## Special Thanks

Great leaders fanned the flames of my growth, pushing me beyond what I thought
possible. Above all, I give a heartfelt thanks to **God ♥️** for blessing me
with opportunities to shine red and bright.

## What’s Next?

This is _The Red Journey_—my space to explore, build, and share. Got a web dev
project or a wild idea? Let’s make it burn red together. Reach out, and let’s
create something unforgettable.

— Gilles, the Red Wanderer
