Hey there! I’m **Gilles Hoarau**, aka _unicolored_—a versatile creative
developer with a passion for painting the tech world red. Welcome to _The Red
Journey_, where I share years of coding, creating, and collaborating—always with
a bold, red-hot twist.

This is _The Red Journey_—my space to explore, build, and share. Got a web dev
project or a wild idea? Let’s make it burn red together. Reach out, and let’s
create something unforgettable.

— Gilles, the Red Wanderer
