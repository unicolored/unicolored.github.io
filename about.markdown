Hey there! I’m **Gilles Hoarau**, aka *unicolored*—a versatile creative developer with a passion for painting the tech world red. Welcome to *The Red Journey*, where I share 18 years of coding, creating, and collaborating—always with a bold, red-hot twist.

## A Career in Red
For nearly two decades, I’ve served clients and partners—small startups to global giants—both solo and with brilliant teams. From web dev challenges to bleeding-edge innovation, I’m ready to tackle it all. How can I assist *you*?

## Special Thanks
Great leaders fanned the flames of my growth, pushing me beyond what I thought possible. Above all, I give a heartfelt thanks to **God ♥️** for blessing me with opportunities to shine red and bright.

## What’s Next?
This is *The Red Journey*—my space to explore, build, and share. Got a web dev project or a wild idea? Let’s make it burn red together. Reach out, and let’s create something unforgettable.

— Gilles, the Red Wanderer
