ChessPop is designed to display live chess games in a spectator interactive 3D
mode. Take a snack, enjoy!

I hope it will help online players like me to keep a real perception and
analysis of the chess games. Chessfield is connected to live stream data (like
lichess.org/tv).

Behind ChessPop, there is the open-source library [chessfield][link1].
