  'Say hello to Chesspop Live‚Äîa snappier name, sound effects, and the same 3D
  chess goodness. Check out the update!'
---

Last week, I shared the first version of my little chess project, originally
called _Chessfield Live_
([read it here](/projects/2025/03/13/introducing-chessfield-live.md.html)).
Since then, things have evolved a bit, and I‚Äôm excited to give you an update:
it‚Äôs now üçø **Chesspop Live**, with a new name, some fresh features, and the
same 3D chess magic you loved. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## A New Name: Chesspop Live üçø

First off, why the name change? I originally went with _Chessfield Live_ to tie
it to my [Chessfield](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chessfield) package, but I
realized it wasn‚Äôt quite popping (pun intended) for casual chess fans like me.
_Chesspop Live_ is shorter, catchier, and works great in both English and
French‚Äîperfect for grabbing some popcorn and enjoying a game! You can check it
out live at [chesspop.live](https://chesspop.live).

## Sound Effects: Feel the Game

One of the coolest new additions is **sound**. Now, when you watch a game,
you‚Äôll hear the pieces pop! It‚Äôs a small touch, but it really brings that
over-the-board vibe to your screen. I wanted _Chesspop_ to feel alive, not just
look it, and sound was the missing piece (pun intended again!).

## Same 3D Goodness, Powered by Chessfield

The core hasn‚Äôt changed: _Chesspop Live_ still uses my
[Chessfield](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chessfield) package to render live
games in 3D. It pulls streams from places like
[Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/tv), so you can spectate real-time matches
with a fresh, interactive twist. Whether it‚Äôs a blitz battle or a slow strategy
showdown, it‚Äôs all there in glorious 3D.

## What‚Äôs Next?

I‚Äôm thrilled with how _Chesspop Live_ is shaping up, but there‚Äôs more to come!
I‚Äôm thinking about adding options to pick specific streamers or games, maybe
even some fun visual themes. Got ideas? I‚Äôd love to hear them‚Äîdrop me a note via
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/unicolored/chesspop.live/issues)!

## Try It Out

Head over to [chesspop.live](https://chesspop.live) and give it a spin. The UI‚Äôs
smooth, the 3D board‚Äôs popping, and now the sounds make it feel like you‚Äôre
right at the table. Grab a snack, turn up your speakers, and enjoy the show! If
you love what you see and want to support more chessy goodness, feel free to
[buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/unicolored)‚Äîit keeps the popcorn
flowing!

Thanks for following along‚Äîstay tuned for more chessy updates!
