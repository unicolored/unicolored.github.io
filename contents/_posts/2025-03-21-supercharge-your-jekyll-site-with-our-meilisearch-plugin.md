Hey there, Jekyll enthusiasts! 🌟 Introducing our latest innovation: a Jekyll
plugin that integrates seamlessly with Meilisearch to bring you lightning-fast
search capabilities!

## 🔍✨ What's under the hood?

Our Jekyll Meilisearch Plugin is all about efficiency and speed. It indexes your
site's content, including posts and pages, into Meilisearch—an open-source,
typo-tolerant search engine that delivers relevant results in a flash.

## 🏎️💨 Key Features:

- Incremental Indexing: Only syncs changes between your Jekyll site and
  Meilisearch, saving you time and resources.
- Configurable Settings: Customize fields, collections through your \_config.yml
  file.
- Robust Error Handling: Includes retries and fallback options to ensure smooth
  operation.

## Getting Started: 🛠️

Add the gem to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-meilisearch", "~> 0.4.1" # beta version
```

- Run bundle install.
- Configure your \_config.yml with Meilisearch settings.
- Build your site and watch the magic happen! 🪄
