I’m thrilled to announce that **Chessfield 1.2.0** is out as of March 12, 2025!
🎉 This isn’t just any update—it’s the moment Chessfield goes public! 😊

With 1.2.0, we've opened up the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/unicolored/chessfield) for everyone to explore
and contribute to. Plus, the npm package is now live and (fingers crossed 🤞)
working smoothly. This is the first public release, so rather than a laundry
list of features, it’s all about getting Chessfield out into the world and into
your hands. 🚀

Want to dive in? Head over to the official project page on our blog at
[https://unicolored.com/chessfield](https://unicolored.com/chessfield). That’s
where you’ll find more info, links to the repo and package, and a chance to join
the chess fun! ♟️

Big thanks to everyone who’s been cheering this on—let’s build something awesome
together! 🙌
